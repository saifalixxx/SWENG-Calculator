In this assignment, you need to be working in pairs with your assigned member to develop a simple calculator app using Git and GitHub. The app will be developed using a language of your choice. The app will interactively take a string representing a simple mathematical expression from the user (e.g. “12435+34569-12345*10+50”). After the user inputs the string, the app will check if the string represents a valid expression (no unexpected string characters, no duplicate operation characters, etc.). After validating the expression, the app will output a string containing the result. In case of invalid expression, it should output an appropriate error message.  For simplicity, we will consider only addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations. Also, we will only consider integers.
You should apply the branching concept in your repo for developing the program. Also, you should write suitable unit tests to be run in the CI workflow that will be triggered when pushing or merging into the main branch.  
Note the following:

    You need to submit a short document with a brief description of the contribution of each member, a link to the repo and a graph of the commit log.
    You need to add the account ‘demonstrators’ to the repo.
    Late submissions will result in a penalty of 4 marks per day.
    The submission deadline is on Monday 10/10/2022 at 23:59.
